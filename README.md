# ESP32 MQTT Client

Below is a brief description of the __Flutter GUI__ application controls the pseudo-generator of the __ECG__ signal running on the __ESP32-S3__, and also visualizes the signal generated by this chip.

## Introduction

In essence, this application is a clone of the [__ECG MQTT SERVICE__](https://github.com/mk590901/ECG-MQTT-SERVICE) application, which has some additions that allow to control the __ESP32-S3__ chip. To be more precise, current __ESP32 MQTT Client ≈ ECG MQTT SERVICE + [ESP32 Control Panel](https://github.com/mk590901/ESP32-Control-Panel)__.

To clarify the implementation features, it is enough to refer to the https://github.com/mk590901/ECG-MQTT-SERVICE, https://github.com/mk590901/ESP32-Control-Panel and https://github.com/mk590901/TOIT-ECG-GENERATOR repositories. The latter contains information about the application written in Toit for the __ESP32-S3 μ-controller__.

## Features

The application can only visualize the __ECG__ signal of third-party source. In our case this is a __ECG wave__ incoming from __ESP32-S3__ μ-controller.

## Additions

The application has two additional buttons:

1) __Start/Final__ - start or stop generating a pseudo ECG signal on the __ESP32-S3__.
2) __Stop__ the application running on the __ESP32-S3__.
